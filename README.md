# Clue
Hello!!!

    Link to Youtube Demo: https://youtu.be/33Id0Z9RXRc
    I made a version of Clue in C for a CS class in fall 2020.
    
My implementation features a main function where the initialization, input, and game loop occur. I initialize
the three main data structures: Items, Rooms, and Characters. They are defined in their respective .h and .c files
as structs with relevant functions defined. 

See README.txt for a more in-depth documentation.
